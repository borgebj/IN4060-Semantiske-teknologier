IN3060 oblig 4 – Entailment
Exercise 2.1

[1]
Yes, with the derivation:
1. sim:Marge  fam:hasSpouse  sim:Homer – P
2. fam:hasSpouse  rdfs:domain  foaf:Person – P
3. sim:Marge  rdf:type  foaf:Person – rdfs2, 1,2


[2]
Yes, this is true because it is specified in the family.ttl in exercise 1.7


[3]
No, this is not true.
We can derive using rdfs2 that sim:Marge is a foaf:Person, but we can not say that sim:Marge is a fam:Woman because she is a foaf:Person.


[4]
Yes, with the derivation:
1. fam:hasBrother  rdfs:range  fam:Man – P
2. _:2  fam:hasBrother  sim:Herb – P
3. sim:Herb  rdf:type  fam:Man – rdfs3, 1,2


[5]
Yes, with the derivation:
1. fam:hasFather  rdfs:subPropertyOf  fam:isRelativeOf – P
2. sim:Lisa  fam:hasFather  sim:homer – P
3. sim:Lisa  fam:isRelativeOf  sim:Homer – rdfs7, 1,2


[6]
No this is not true.
This is because there is no rule that can be applied where a conclusion of Lisa having Marge as mother can be met.
It can be believed blank node 1 represents Marge and lisa hasParent blank node 1, but this never specifies neither if it is Lisa’s mother nor it being actually Marge.


[7]
1. fam:hasSister  rdf:range  fam:Woman – P
2. _:1  fam:hasSister  sim:Patty – P
3. sim:Patty  rdf:type  fam:Woman – rdfs3, 1,2
4. fam:Woman  rdfs:subClassOf  foaf:Person – P
5. sim:Patty  rdf:type  foaf:Person – rdfs9, 4,3


[8]
_:a  fam:hasParent  _:b      
_:b  fam:hasSister  sim:Patty
